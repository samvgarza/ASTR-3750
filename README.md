# ASTR-3750
the final project of the Planets, Moons, and Rings course at CU Boulder - Fall 2020 
will have to manually adjust run times and size of average crater
not the best but i think it got me an A

# Impact Crater Saturation Simulation
generates a random crater distribution on a 500x500km plot over the course of a designated time period, uses a simple method at determining if a crater has been "obliterated" by a newly generated crater or if its considered an entirely new crater. 
also finds the saturation time for this partuicular plot of land
produced the plots found in this repository at different period of time
